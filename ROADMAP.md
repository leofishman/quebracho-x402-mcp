## Tasks (hackathon and app)

The gaps x402_pay found refactoring onto the library (G1–G13) all go in before submitting (D10).

Tasks for the library are in [packages/x402/ROADMAP.md](packages/x402/ROADMAP.md).

- [x] Settle on testnet (Base Sepolia) through a facilitator.
- [ ] Screening in the app: warn when the OFAC list is stale (mtime older than N days).
- [ ] Try the server with MCP Inspector.

## After the hackathon

- phay.io: a hosted registry of trusted sellers and reported addresses, behind the `AddressCheck` hook.
- The Drupal module `x402_pay` uses this library.
